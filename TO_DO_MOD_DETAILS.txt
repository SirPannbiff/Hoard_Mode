Next Update Patch Notes:

1.25a
Gold bags should no longer break invisibility or channeling abilities (Weaver fans rejoice)

Items
Cursed Rapier: no longer drops on death
Sacred Trident: rewritten as datadriven with lua functions to fix all interactions with pure damage proc (does not stack, works properly on illusions, and works on hero creeps)
Willful Resonance: new item, battlefury alternative for rightclickers focused around magical damage

Difficulty
Auras return to Medium difficulty
Aura chance now scales with difficulty: 0%/9%/12%/15%
Bosses no longer spawn Mysterious Orbs; Rapier Ogre now drops 5 Mysterious Orbs
